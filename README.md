# ETHernals Hackathon project
This project is made keeping in mind the way StackOverFlow works.<br>
Users can come on the Super app and can post their doubts which they want to be answered by the community! Anyone can approach the question and post their answers.<br>

Other peers form the community can come and either post their own answers to a doubt or upvote a posted answer.

This helps to understand the level of contribution experience a person might have and is worthy in the eyes of the developer commuinty for a reward. The Doubt poster has an option to attach a reward amount with the doubt, and if the worthy person comes the contract will start a stream of rewards to that person's wallet!

This provides a challenging environment and a lot of room for development of each answer quality. As if someone else achieves higher number of upvotes, the stream of rewards will be redirected to the new worthy person.

##Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
